# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   "true": "foo"

          Manager in your Azure subscription. At the end of this process, you should
          have a highly-available instance of Rancher running on AKS. To get
          the most out of your Rancher experience, we recommend you familiarize
          yourself with the product documentation:
          [Rancher Docs](https://rancher.com/docs/)


          You shouldn't have to be an expert in container management to run Rancher.
          **SUSE Rancher Setup** will make the process as easy as we can make it…
          you’ll just need to provide a few things to deploy Rancher on a dedicated
          AKS cluster, sized just right for your needs.


          ### What we need from you

          1. **Azure service principal**
          In order to perform the set up for you, this application needs to access
          Azure - service principal credentials need to be provided, with
          persmission to create and modify AKS clusters and nodegroups,
          and Azure DNS Zone records in an existing hosted zone.
          [More Info](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals)

          2. **An Azure DNS Zone.** We need to give your Rancher server a
          domain name,. To do so, the subdomain we use needs to be configured
          as an Azure DNS Zone. We'll take care of the DNS record for
          Rancher, and make sure it's all properly routed, you just need to give
          us a place to work. It can be a public zone or a private zone, as long as
          it is resolvable by this virtual machine and your PC, and the
          *Azure service principal* you provide has rights to edit the zone.
          [More Info](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/)


          ### Let's go


          When you have that ready, click the big, orange **Next** button to get
          started, and go ahead and brew a cup of coffee or tea... *the full
          deployment will take about 20 minutes.*"

          ### What we need from you

          1. **AWS permissions** In order to perform the set up for you, this
          application needs to access AWS - this virtual machine must have an
          *associated IAM instance profile* with
          persmission to create and modify EKS clusters and nodegroups, VPCs,
          subnets, routes, Internet Gateways, NATs, elastic IP addresses, EC2
          instances and auto-scaling groups, and Route53 records in an existing
          hosted zone.
          [More Info](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html#launch-instance-with-role)
          | [Required permissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SUSE-Enceladus/suse-rancher-setup/main/aws-iam/iam_role.json)

          2. **A Route53 Hosted Zone.** We need to give your Rancher server a
          domain name, and to do so, the subdomain we use needs to be configured
          as an AWS Route53 hosted zone. We'll take care of the DNS record for
          Rancher, and make sure it's all properly routed, you just need to give
