  greeting:
    content: "This tool is designed to automate the deployment of Rancher
      Manager in your Azure subscription. At the end of this process, you should
      have a highly-available instance of Rancher running on AKS. To get
      the most out of your Rancher experience, we recommend you familiarize
      yourself with the product documentation:
      [Rancher Docs](https://rancher.com/docs/)


      You shouldn't have to be an expert in container management to run Rancher.
      **SUSE Rancher Setup** will make the process as easy as we can make it…
      you’ll just need to provide a few things to deploy Rancher on a dedicated
      AKS cluster, sized just right for your needs.


      ### What we need from you

      1. **Azure service principal**
      In order to perform the set up for you, this application needs to access
      Azure - service principal credentials need to be provided, with
      persmission to create and modify AKS clusters and nodegroups,
      and Azure DNS Zone records in an existing hosted zone.
      [More Info](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals)

      2. **An Azure DNS Zone.** We need to give your Rancher server a
      domain name,. To do so, the subdomain we use needs to be configured
      as an Azure DNS Zone. We'll take care of the DNS record for
      Rancher, and make sure it's all properly routed, you just need to give
      us a place to work. It can be a public zone or a private zone, as long as
      it is resolvable by this virtual machine and your PC, and the
      *Azure service principal* you provide has rights to edit the zone.

      ### Let's go


      When you have that ready, click the big, orange **Next** button to get
      started, and go ahead and brew a cup of coffee or tea... *the full
      deployment will take about 20 minutes.*"

        to manage with your Rancher server, but we also don't want you to waste
        resources on capacity you don't need. We just need a general idea of
        what your plans are, and we'll set things up accordingly. Think of it as
        finding the 'shirt size' for your deployment.


        The measurement we use is the number of kubernetes nodes that will be
        managed by your Rancher server."
