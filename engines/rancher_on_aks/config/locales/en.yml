        to manage with your Rancher server, but we also don't want you to waste
        resources on capacity you don't need. We just need a general idea of
        what your plans are, and we'll set things up accordingly. Think of it as
        finding the 'shirt size' for your deployment.


        The measurement we use is the number of kubernetes nodes that will be
        managed by your Rancher server."

          be ready in about 20 minutes, and we'll tell you how to access it."
